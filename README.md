## NY-News App

to run the task just pull the main branch and use android studio Artcic Fox | 2020.3.1 patch 4 once the setup done the task app should work either in real android phone
or emulater.

you can run all unit tests just by using the options in click right menu to run all the tests in unit tests folder.

for the code coverage i tired to use this jacoco libaray but it seems that it has an issues with gradle. any way we can use the options Run tests with coverage from
toolbar menu options in android studio.
